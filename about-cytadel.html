    <section class="orange-banner">

        <strong style="font-size: 1.25rem;">CYTADEL exists because we believe people deserve better.</strong><br><br>

        Better than 7-minute visits. Better than confusing bills. Better than waiting weeks just to be dismissed in
        minutes.<br><br>

        The traditional medical system wasn’t built for patients (or physicians). It was built to extract profit from
        illness. For too many people over
        the last 20 years, insurance premiums have risen over 250%, deductibles have tripled, and out-of-pocket
        costs are higher than ever, yet outcomes haven’t improved. Chronic disease is more common, and patients are
        often treated like a billing code on a schedule, not a human being with a story.<br><br>

        One of the biggest flaws in modern healthcare is the misuse of insurance. It was never intended to manage
        everyday care; it was meant to protect against major, unexpected costs, similar to how car insurance is used for
        major accidents, but not for filling up with gas or routine vehicle maintenance. With corporations inserting
        themselves into
        routine visits
        and basic preventive care, the system has grown inefficient, expensive, and slow, creating layers of
        administration that add cost without adding value.<br><br>

        Insurance companies and hospital networks have wedged themselves between doctors and patients, turning care
        into coding, trust into transactions, and chronic illness into a business model. Your plan costs more and
        covers less, not because it has to, but because that's how the system was designed to profit.<br><br>

        The result? Shorter visits. Overburdened doctors. More paperwork. We’re paying more than ever,
        and getting less of what actually matters: time, trust, and real human care.<br><br>

        <strong>We’re done with that.</strong><br><br>

        CYTADEL is a rejection of that system and a return to what medicine was always meant to be: a trusted
        relationship between a doctor and a patient, guided data, experience, and mutual respect.<br><br>

        We don’t take insurance because we believe you shouldn’t need permission to care for your health. Instead,
        we offer a simple monthly membership, transparent visit fees, and direct access to your doctor with same- or
        next-day appointments. No middlemen. No surprise bills. No waiting months for a rushed appointment.<br><br>

        <strong>You deserve a system built to serve you. We’re building it at CYTADEL.</strong><br><br>
        Real reform begins at the foundation, and in healthcare, that foundation is primary care. It’s where most
        medical needs are met and where trust is built. By applying our simple, transparent model here first, we’re
        creating a stable platform for future expansion into specialty care and, eventually, the entire healthcare
        system.

                    <strong>Dr. Christopher Lee</strong> is a physician and healthcare entrepreneur committed to
                    rebuilding trust in medicine.
                    After years of working within a system that often sidelines both patients and doctors, he set out to
                    design something
                    better: care that is personal, transparent, and focused on results. His passion for reform is shaped
                    by studying
                    healthcare models around the world and by a belief
                    that lasting
                    health is built through strong relationships, clear goals, and the freedom to pursue what truly
                    matters to each individual.
