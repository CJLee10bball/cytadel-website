        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <details>
            <summary>Do you accept insurance?</summary>
            <p>No. CYTADEL is a direct care model that removes insurance middlemen so care can be simpler, more
                transparent, and personalized.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What does the membership include?</summary>
            <p>Membership includes direct access to your physician, same- or next-day appointments, extended visit
                times, and discounted rates on additional services.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What if I need labs, imaging, or referrals?</summary>
            <p>We offer wholesale pricing on labs and medications and coordinate affordable imaging and referrals with
                local partners. Pricing is always transparent.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Can I use my HSA or FSA to pay for CYTADEL?</summary>
            <p>Usually. Most Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) can be used to pay for
                CYTADEL services. Starting in 2026, HSA funds can be used to pay for services in Texas.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Can I cancel my membership?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Our membership is month-to-month with no lock-in contracts. Cancel anytime with no penalties.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What if I already have insurance?</summary>
            <p>You can still use your insurance for things like catastrophic care, hospitalization, or specialist
                visits. CYTADEL covers the day-to-day care insurance wasn’t designed for.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What kinds of conditions do you manage?</summary>
            <p>We manage everything from chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes to urgent concerns,
                preventive care, and performance medicine in adults and children.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Do you offer virtual visits?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Virtual care is included as part of your membership, along with messaging access and quick follow-up
                when needed.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How is this different from concierge medicine?</summary>
            <p>Concierge practices typically bill insurance on top of a large membership fee. CYTADEL is simpler, more
                transparent, and designed to be accessible, not elite.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why don’t you participate in the insurance system at all?</summary>
            <p>Because we believe health decisions should be made between doctor and patient, not dictated by billing
                codes or corporate policies. Insurance has distorted the purpose of primary care and introduced
                unnecessary complexity, cost, and delay.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Why is there a monthly fee and a charge for each visit?</summary>
            <p>CYTADEL’s goal is to make personalized, physician-led care accessible to everyone.
                Traditional Direct Primary Care (DPC) practices usually include unlimited visits in a higher monthly
                fee. At CYTADEL, we keep your membership cost low to maintain ongoing access to your physician and our
                system, while visit fees are charged only when you’re seen.
                For most people, this structure is much for cost-effective. You’d typically need to see your DPC doctor
                seven or more times in a year for a traditional flat-fee model to be more cost-effective than CYTADEL’s
                pay-for-what-you-use approach. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What does it mean that CYTADEL is modeled after Singapore's healthcare system?</summary>
            <p>Singapore’s healthcare system is known for its high quality, low cost, and efficient use of public and
                private resources. CYTADEL draws inspiration from that model by combining personal responsibility with
                clear, upfront pricing. The small monthly subscription fee is similar in concept to how Singaporeans
                contribute a portion of their income toward medical savings accounts through taxation. Most healthcare
                spending in Singapore is paid directly by patients at the point of care, not funneled through complex
                insurance systems, which keeps prices transparent and market-driven. Like Singapore’s system, CYTADEL
                emphasizes preventive care, financial transparency, and a strong doctor-patient relationship while
                avoiding the bureaucracy that drives up costs in traditional insurance-based care.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Is CYTADEL aligned with functional or holistic medicine?</summary>
            <p>CYTADEL shares many values with those approaches: whole-person care, root-cause analysis, and
                prevention-first thinking. But we combine that with rigorous science, clear communication, and a deep
                respect for the patient-doctor relationship.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Do you treat patients who just want conventional care?</summary>
            <p>Absolutely. You don’t need to follow a specific lifestyle or philosophy to be cared for at CYTADEL.
                Whether you want to optimize longevity, manage a chronic condition, or just have a doctor who listens,
                you’re welcome here.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you accept Bitcoin?</summary>
            <p>Yes. We accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for membership and services. In fact, we offer a 10% discount
                when your annual membership is paid in full with bitcoin.
                We believe Bitcoin preserves the value of your time and maintaining your health is the best way to fully
                take
                advantage of that time. Both are long-term investments in personal freedom, independence, and
                resilience.</p>
